project: layer-wise video compression

MyEncoder
    - inputs:
        - input_video.rgb video file
            - resolution = 960 x 540 pixels = 518,400 pixels = 518,400 * 3 bytes per frame
                - each pixel = 3 bytes = R, G, B channel data
            - data = frame1, frame2, frame3...
                - each frame =  (all R bytes), (all G bytes), (all B bytes)
            - frame rate = 30 fps
            - video lengths = varied
                - read each frame until no frames left
        - n1 = quantization step for foreground macroblocks
        - n2 = quantization step for background macroblocks
    - outputs:
        - input_video.cmp compressed video file 
    - steps:
        - 0. pre-process file data 
        - 1. video segmentation
        - 2. compression

MyDecoder
    - inputs:
        - input_video.cmp compressed video file 
            - AKA, the output of MyEncoder
        - input_audio.wav
            - audio files --> .wav folder
                - mp4
                - 44.1 KHz
    - outputs:
        - rendered video + audio
            - displayed by an A/V player w/ synchronized audio-video playback
            - playback has stop/pause/play/step capabilities
                - allows for frame-by-frame observation
    - steps:
        - 3. decompression
        - 4. decoding 


AudioVideoPlayer --> CONFIGURATION
    - java JDK version --> 21 (21.0.5)
    - download JavaFX --> https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/
        - I did version MacOS 23.0.1 aarch64 SDK
            - my laptop = mac w/ M1 chip btw
        - after it downloads, unzip it (don't need to unzip the src stuff)
            - should be see the "lib" folder with .jars in it
    - configure
        - .vscode folder 
            - tasks.json --> for build task
                - mine didn't already exist so I made it... I'm assuming if you pull from main yours 
                yours will automatically be the same as mine
                - *** you'll need to change "--module-path" to where your javaFX lib folder is on your laptop
            - launch.json --> dependencies for launching javaFX
                - *** you'll need to change "--module-path" again
    - try to build the project 
        - make sure you have the Java Extensions Manager extension (lets you build in VScode)
        - command shift b
    - *** mine built right (AVplayer.class file was made), but was still have import errors
        - to fix import errors --> had to change the user settings.json to directly link to JavaFX
            - command+shift+P "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)"
            - can send you the lines I had to add if you need them 


Notes:

11/23/24 Greg:  Wrote computeMotionVector code. My scoping may not be ideal, like having prevFrame3DArray be a global variable
                Maybe we can talk about that bc I feel like I never quite learned that right
                Have not tested computeMotionVector stuff
                Also, I'm getting an error where the file name should be MyEncoder not myEncoder but
                I'm scared to change the name because of git reasons lol can you do that

11/27/24 Greg:  Think I fixed some computeMotionVector bugs related to the fractional macroblocks
                Still need to implement checkContiguous and scanMacroblock
                Need to test getLayers

11/27/24 Greg:  Implemented checkContiguous but layers code seems to not be working
                Maybe because mostCommonVector or computeMotionVector is not working

12/4/24 Greg: Fixed getLayers, mostCommonVector, and computeMotionVector -- everything should be working now except writing to a file
